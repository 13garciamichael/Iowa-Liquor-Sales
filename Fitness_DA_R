## Clean Data

### Variable types

class(activity$ActivityDate)

### Convert character to date format

### Intensity
Intensities$ActivityHour=as.POSIXct(Intensities$ActivityHour, format="%m/%d/%Y %I:%M:%S %p", tz=Sys.timezone())
Intensities$time <- format(Intensities$ActivityHour, format = "%H:%M:%S")
Intensities$date <- format(Intensities$ActivityHour, format = "%m/%d/%y")
### calories
hourlyCalories_merged$ActivityHour=as.POSIXct(hourlyCalories_merged$ActivityHour, format="%m/%d/%Y %I:%M:%S %p", tz=Sys.timezone())
hourlyCalories_merged$time <- format(hourlyCalories_merged$ActivityHour, format = "%H:%M:%S")
hourlyCalories_merged$date <- format(hourlyCalories_merged$ActivityHour, format = "%m/%d/%y")
### activity
d_activity$ActivityDate=as.POSIXct(d_activity$ActivityDate, format="%m/%d/%Y", tz=Sys.timezone())
d_activity$date <- format(d_activity$ActivityDate, format = "%m/%d/%y")
### sleep
sleep$SleepDay=as.POSIXct(sleep$SleepDay, format="%m/%d/%Y %I:%M:%S %p", tz=Sys.timezone())
sleep$date <- format(sleep$SleepDay, format = "%m/%d/%y")


### verify correct data type

class(calories$ActivityHour)
class(heartrate$Time)
class(Intensities$ActivityHour)
class(sleep$SleepDay)
class(weight$Date)

### rename dataset

d_activity <- dailyActivity_merged

### summarizing data

n_distinct(d_activity$Id)
n_distinct(calories$Id)
n_distinct(Intensities$Id)
n_distinct(sleep$Id)
n_distinct(weight$Id)

### activity
d_activity %>%  
  select(TotalSteps,
         TotalDistance,
         SedentaryMinutes, Calories) %>%
  summary()

### explore num of active minutes per category
d_activity %>%
  select(VeryActiveMinutes, FairlyActiveMinutes, LightlyActiveMinutes) %>%
  summary()

### calories
calories %>%
  select(Calories) %>%
  summary()
### sleep
sleep %>%

### How does activity intensity affect the loss of calories? - high activity leads to more burning of calories than low activity

ggplot(data=d_activity, aes(x=LightlyActiveMinutes, y=Calories)) + 
  geom_point() + geom_smooth() + labs(title="Light Activity vs Calories")


ggplot(data=d_activity, aes(x=VeryActiveMinutes, y=Calories)) + 
  geom_point() + geom_smooth() + labs(title="High Activity vs Calories")

### Average total calories Vs time of the day - People are most active beteween 5-7 (After work)

calories_new <- hourlyCalories_merged %>%
  group_by(time) %>%
  drop_na() %>%
  summarise(mean_total_calories = mean(Calories))

ggplot(data=calories_new, aes(x=time, y=mean_total_calories)) + geom_histogram(stat = "identity", fill='darkgreen') +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90)) +
  labs(title="Average Total Calories vs. Time")

### Sleep Vs Sedentary - people are most sedentary when they sleep < 200 minutes or > 600 minutes *(data may be insufficient). 
Sedentary minutes cna be correlated lack of proper rest to be active throughout the day which is often a result of under or overseleeping. 

sleep_sed_2 <- sleep_sedentary %>% 
group_by(TotalMinutesAsleep) %>%
  drop_na() %>%
  summarise(mean_sedentary = mean(SedentaryMinutes))

ggplot(data=sleep_sed_2, aes(x=TotalMinutesAsleep, y=mean_sedentary)) + 
  geom_point() + geom_smooth() + labs(title="sedentary vs sleep")

### Are the moajority of steps being taken by lighly or very active participants? 

ggplot(data=d_activity, aes(x=VeryActiveMinutes, y=TotalSteps)) + 
  geom_point() + geom_smooth() + labs(title="Very Active Minutes vs Total Steps")


ggplot(data=d_activity, aes(x=LightlyActiveMinutes, y=TotalSteps)) + 
  geom_point() + geom_smooth() + labs(title="Lightly Minutes vs Total Steps")

### highly active distance people burn more calories. many appear to be runners as they take many more steps in less than half the time. 
### Most participants are lightly active and most likely dont like running. the lightly active VS very active comparisons showed that
### very active participants burn more calories. 

Conclusions:
1.suggest highly active fun excersizes like dancing and swimming to get clients
to be more highly active without having to run and burn calories in half the time. (Not to mention these are year round options)
2. For those ot willing to be more active, prgram app to send notifications to cleints that arent logging many active munutes
(and are falling below recommended daily step range) that remind clients to stand up every 20-30 minutes to an hour (they can choose)
in oder to redice sedentary time,and get some extra steps in, light activity in between sedentary moments at work. Just doing this 
can make them feel better over time and can be the gateway to more active excersixes in the future. 
3. Emhasize the importance of proper rest. Clients who get sufficient rest are spending less time sedentary. Automate the calculation of calories 
a client bruns sitting down sitting vs engaging in light, moderae or hight activity so they can see the a quantifiable difference oft their choices. 
we can take it a step further and show them how many calories theyll burn in a 1-3-9 -12 month span if they continue to be active in the same way and 
how much weight they can lose if they do that Vs how muany calories theyll keep and weight theyll gain or keep over a 1-3-6-9-12 month sspan if they choose 
to be sedentary and inactivity.
